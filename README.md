# Dragon-Beta Add-ons
Add-on boards by Phill Harvey-Smith for ease of use and construction today.

## Background
The Dragon Beta was a machine in development at the time of Dragon Data's demise in 1984. Only three boards are known to have existed - and only one can be located now. The one board which remains is in the care of the Dragon Data archive at http://www.dragondata.co.uk. It is this latter board which has formed the basis for this current reverse engineering project. Richard, from the Dragon Data archive had made some very clear photographs of his Dragon Beta board before, during and after it's restoration. That board was returned to working order, but understandably Richard was not keen to continually use such a rare piece of computing history. The board was apparently rescued by the Dragon Data M.D. as he left the building for the final time. The Dragon Beta disks were still held by Duncan Smeed of 'Inside the Dragon' fame, and he supplied those to Richard for imaging.

## Improvements and Addons

Many of the components used on the Dragon Beta are obsolete - to the point of being almost unobtainable. Phill has gone to great lengths to create some good add-on boards which can be used to replace the archaic SRAM chips that handle paging, as well as replacing the 32 DRAM chips which provided the original 256K. These are replaced by a small daughterboard. He has also created a 512KB expansion RAM which plugs into the expansion port and effectively takes the machine to 768K of RAM.

Another archaic part of the Beta was its use of the original Sony 26-pin floppy drive connector. This is different to the Amstrad 26-pin connector. Phill has put together a 26-pin to 34-pin adapter, which allows the connection of normal floppy disk drives.

The last area for now is improvements to the keyboard interface. The original Dragon Beta used a matrix scanned/bit serialised keyboard. As with many other old machines, Phill put together a PS/2 keyboard adapter, and in addition now has a USB keyboard and mouse adapter (yes, the Dragon Beta had a mouse - it also had a light pen - but we will likely leave that back in 1984!)

## Disclaimer

These boards have been built and tested and proven to work so far as testing that has been carried out has shown. No warranty is given regarding the suitability or reliability of these boards, and as such, they are supplied as-is for your enjoyment. Any feedback is always welcome.
